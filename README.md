# BREAKAIT

This Breakout clone is a quick experiment with using AI to code. I started with Gemini CLI, which did a great job at zero-shotting it, but when I started to make changes I quickly ran out of tokens. I used Cursor to pick up where Gemini left off. It took me about an hour I guess. I particularly love the sounds!

It might be fun to train an AI how to play it :)
